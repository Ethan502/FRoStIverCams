Threading needs to be faster
    Three cameras currently can do 30 images in about 13 seconds. This needs to be closer to 5 seconds
    Cameras must also be able to take photos at the exact same time

Ideas:
    Image compression
    Objects that save the image as an array, writes the .jpg later
    Dynamic coding (C++)
    Images save all at the same time
